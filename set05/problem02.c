The smallest of 1/2, 1/3 and 1/4 is 1/4*/

#include<stdio.h>

typedef struct {
    int num, den;
} Fraction;

find the smallest of three fracions
input the denominator and numerator of three numbers
compare the three numbers
(need to calculate the value of (1/3) num/den and that result need to be compared)
print the result
